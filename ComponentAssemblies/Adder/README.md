An AND and an XOR can each be made with two relays, and since, in a half/full adder each pair of AND and XOR gates have the same inputs, we can use two DPDT relays for a full adder, as shown in the FullAdder image.
After that, we can abstract the full adder into a block, and make an 8-bit ripple carry adder, as shown in the 8-bitAdder image.
