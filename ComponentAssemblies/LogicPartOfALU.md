The AND and XOR gates gan be made with two relays, as in the adder, an OR gate can be made by hooking up B to NC, Vcc to NO and A to the relay coil and COM is the output, and a NOT can be made in the same relay by connecting Vcc to COM (A still connected to the coil) and the output connected to NC, as in the image.

Then if we put eight of these together, we get the Logic part of the ALU.
