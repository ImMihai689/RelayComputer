A latch can be made by hooking up the relay's output (NO) to it's input (one pin of the coil). When the input turns on, a feedback loop is created and the relays stays on. to reset it, a second relay can be used to cut off power to the COM pin. This is favorable since one reset relays can be used for n-bit registers since they all reset at once. And to prevent the relays being constantly set, we have another set of relays to act as a buffer bewteen the bus and latches. Thus we and up with a register that has a Reset pin, a pin for writing from the bus, a bus conenction and an output.
